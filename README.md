## Getting Started

I made a program that compares classic movies to the movies that are based off of them and rating them based off of accuracy to the book. 

I used CRUD to create my mailing list sign up form and save the information to my back end.

I used axios to pull data from my back end to show on my front end in the form of movies and their information.

## Next Steps:

-add movie and book comparisons
-add book photos to "specific movie" modals
-add create user 
-add log in functionality
-add BiblioCine ratings from users
-add comments under each movie/book review
-add top rated movies to nav bar
