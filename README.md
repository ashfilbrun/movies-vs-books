## Getting Started

I made a program that compares classic movies to the movies that are based off of them and rating them based off of accuracy to the book. 

## Next Steps:

-add book photos to "specific movie" modals
-add create user 
-add log in functionality
-add BiblioCine ratings from users
-add comments under each movie/book review
-add top rated movies to nav bar
